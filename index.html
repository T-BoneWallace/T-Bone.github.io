            <h3 class="post-title">RadRunner 1500km Review</h3>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I've had the pleasure of riding this bike <em>nearly everyday</em> for the past 4 months. Within that time, I've ridden over <strong>1500km</strong>. I usually average 100km per week just from riding to work and back.</p>
                <p>The experience so far has been exellent. I've only had one flat tire. That aside, there have been no flaws. I bought some new brake pads cheaply off <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon.</a> The bike is still running great and has great battery life. It's more than enough to get from work and back (aprox 20km round trip). overall rating, 10/10.</p>

            <h3 class="post-title">Thoughts on RadRunner Upgrades</h3>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Although I've been very satisfied with my bike, there is always room for improvement...</p>
                <p>Eventhough a car like a Honda Civic may be perfect for everyday commuting, there is a lot of fun in slapping a big turbo on it and making it spit flames.</p>
                <p>For this reason, I want my bike faster and sicker. One of the best options is to upgrade the controller. This allows faster accelleration. A motor upgrade would allow for higher top speed, and well as the ability to put more juice into it. Lastly, the battery is one of the most important parts, as voltage is ultimately resonsible to top speed.</p>
